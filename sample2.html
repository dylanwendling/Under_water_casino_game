Your adventure starts by you getting on a train.
As you sit down you feel yourself starting to get sleepy.
Suddenly you fall into a deep sleep. When you wake up there is a harsh darkness surrounding you.
You figure that walking slowly to the door is the best option.
Once you open the door you are met with the soft sounds of water hitting the slick concrete floor.
The train leaves and you are now stranded in a cold and dark cavern.
There is an opening that you start walking through.
It's a dark and humid passage with water dripping from the ceiling.
Finally, you reach a drop off that leads into an underwater passage that is drawing you in.
Luckily you brought your scuba gear along.
Those marine biology classes finally paid off, as your professor always said:
-Take your scuba gear wherever you go and that's an order!-
You picture him yelling at you in the marine biology classroom.
You didn't particularly hate him, you knew he meant well.
You were just in the class to discover the wonders of mermaids.
Your biggest dream was to meet a mermaid in real life and hopefully become friends.
The drop off that leads into an underwater passage of your dreams is in front of you.
Thus you decide to jump right in and explore the area.
