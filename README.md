✨ About the Game
Beneath the Tides is a heartwarming text-based adventure set in a beautifully rendered underwater world where every interaction matters. Unlike traditional adventure games focused solely on puzzles and progression, this experience prioritizes emotional connection—where helping a lost hatchling find his grandpa carries more weight than collecting treasure, and where even the fiercest sharks reveal soft hearts beneath their rough exteriors.
Crafted with meticulous attention to emotional storytelling, this game transforms simple text interactions into profound moments of connection. When Tiko the turtle hatchling sniffles "Grandpa said he'd be back before the current turned...", you don't just complete a quest—you mend a broken family. When the Seal nervously adjusts his bowtie before proposing, you're not just retrieving an item—you're participating in a love story.
"The ocean doesn't just hold water—it holds memories, dreams, and hearts waiting to be found."
🌊 The Story
Long ago, the surface world forgot the magic beneath the waves. But the ocean remembered.
You are a traveler who has descended into these mysterious depths—not by accident, but by calling. The currents themselves guided you here, whispering of creatures in need, of stories untold, of hearts waiting to be mended.
As you explore coral palaces, sunken ships, and bioluminescent gardens, you'll discover that this underwater realm is not merely a setting—it's a living tapestry of interconnected lives:
A turtle elder searches for his lost hatchling while his precious gem remains hidden in a forgotten room
A giant squid guards a sunken ship not out of malice, but from trauma—searching for hatchlings lost in the wreck
A nervous seal practices his proposal speech a hundred times before finding the courage to ask for a ring
Three sharks with reputations to uphold secretly yearn for the childhood comfort of their lost plush toy
A mermaid collects crystals not for vanity, but to preserve fading memories of a world above the waves
Your journey isn't about conquering the depths—it's about listening to them. Every creature you meet carries a piece of the ocean's soul, and by helping them heal, you help the entire ecosystem remember its magic.
🐠 Meet the Characters
🐢 Tiko & The Turtle Elder
"Grandpa said he'd be back before the current turned..."
Tiko is a lost turtle hatchling clutching a seaweed map, waiting at the cave entrance with hopeful sniffles. His grandpa, the ancient Turtle Elder, resides in a living coral palace, his eyes holding centuries of wisdom—and the quiet ache of a missing grandchild.
Quest: Reunite Tiko with his grandpa → Receive the ANCIENT_PEARL
🦈 The Shark Trio (Doug, Smug & Finley)
"We're not just tough guys... we have feelings too!"
"DOUG! We have a reputation!"
Three sharks who project toughness to hide their vulnerability. Doug secretly carved a shark-wearing-a-crown near their grove. Smug maintains their "fearsome" image. Finley just wants his SHARKPLUSH back.
Quest: Return their beloved SHARKPLUSH from the storeroom → Witness their tender reunion
🐙 The Giant Squid
"My hatchlings... where are my hatchlings?!"
Thrashes violently, tentacles coiled tight around the sunken ship's mast
A creature of profound trauma, not malice. Her violent thrashing stems from grief—she lost her hatchlings when the ship sank. She guards the wreck not to block passage, but because it's the last place she saw her children.
Quest: Find and return her hatchlings → Witness her transformation from anguish to peace
💍 The Seal
"What if she says no? What if my bowtie is crooked?!"
Adjusts kelp bowtie nervously for the hundredth time
A romantic soul preparing to propose to his beloved. He needs a ring from the treasure chest, but his anxiety threatens to overwhelm him. His vulnerability makes him one of the ocean's most endearing residents.
Quest: Retrieve the RING from the treasure chest → Help him find courage to propose
👻 The Pirate Ghost & Crew
"Arrr! Me hat has been stolen by scallywags!"
Spectral form shimmers with the fire of a captain who refuses to surrender his ship
The ghost of a captain who perished with his vessel. He's not malevolent—just unfinished business. His crew members linger nearby, forever gazing upward toward stars they'll never see again.
Quest: Return his BICORN_HAT → Help him find peace and rest
🐉 The Sea Dragon
"My hatchling's egg... taken while I hunted. I have not slept since."
Voice rumbles with restrained anguish
A majestic guardian whose DRAGONEGG was stolen and hidden in the ship's cellar. Her protective fury masks deep maternal grief. She doesn't want to harm you—she needs your help to restore her family.
Quest: Return the DRAGONEGG to her lair → Witness ancient guardianship restored
🧜 The Mermaid
"Your heart called to these depths, traveler. I felt its longing across the currents..."
Voice like rippling water, eyes holding centuries of wisdom
A mystical being who collects crystals not for beauty, but to preserve fading memories of the surface world. She senses your purpose before you do—and guides you toward those who need your help most.
Quest: Bring her a SINGING_CRYSTAL → Complete her memory collection
👨‍🍳 The Cook
"A pinch of sea salt makes every dish better."
Moves with practiced grace, ladle a conductor's baton for underwater symphonies
The heart of the underwater community. His restaurant offers warmth and comfort in the cold depths. He speaks little, but his actions—always offering nourishment—speak volumes about his character.
Quest: Bring him fresh SEAWEED → Receive nourishment for your journey
👔 The Designer
Humming softly while stitching royal silk, fingers moving with practiced grace
An artisan who creates garments that flow like water itself. Currently working on royal attire for the King, whose impatience grows with each passing tide.
Quest: Retrieve the KING'S_OUTFIT → Restore royal dignity
🎲 The Gambler
Hollow eyes haunted by Lady Luck's abandonment
A tragic figure surrounded by the remnants of lost fortunes. His desperation lingers around the treasure chest—a reminder that not all treasure brings happiness.
Quest: None (atmospheric character representing the cost of obsession)
👑 The King
Expression displeased, royal clothes incomplete, patience wearing thin
A ruler whose authority depends on proper attire. Without his full regalia, he cannot command respect—even in his own throne room.
Quest: Return his complete royal outfit → Restore order to the kingdom

🎨 Lore & Worldbuilding
The Ocean's Memory
The underwater realm operates on a principle the mermaid calls "current-memory"—the belief that water retains emotional imprints. Trauma lingers as cold spots. Joy creates warm currents. Love leaves bioluminescent traces that glow for generations.
The Great Descent
Long ago, surface-dwellers who felt disconnected from their world heard the ocean's call. They descended not to escape, but to remember—to reconnect with emotional truths the surface had forgotten. Their descendants became the ocean's guardians.
The Balance of Depths
The ecosystem thrives on emotional balance:
Turtle Palace = Patience & Family
Shark Grove = Strength with Vulnerability
Sunken Ship = Memory & Release
Dragon's Lair = Protection & Legacy
Mermaid's Chamber = Wisdom & Preservation
When one area suffers emotional disruption (Tiko lost, DRAGONEGG stolen), the entire ocean feels the imbalance—currents grow turbulent, light dims, creatures become restless. Your journey restores harmony.
The Surface Connection
Though submerged, the world maintains ties to above:
The Crew Member gazes upward for stars
The Mermaid collects crystals to preserve surface memories
The Seal's proposal mimics surface-world romance
Sunbeams filter down as "ghosts of the world above"
This isn't an escape from reality—it's a deeper engagement with emotional truth.
